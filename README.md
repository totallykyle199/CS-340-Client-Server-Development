# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  The best way to keep my programming in a readable and maintainable way is to keep to standard best practices while coding. I try to keep my code organized and looking clean to maintain a good readability and be able to find any code that needs to be changed. The worst thing I could do is jumble my code together and get lost while trying to read through it.

- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  I try to approach the problem with a structured and analytic approach. I frist try to understand the problem then create a plan of action to follow as I develope the program. I test my code were I can and keep into the requirements that the client wants from me. The main difference between this project and others is the use of multiple files working together, in previous courses I only used one programming file to create the clients needs. On technique I will use it to keep the code organized and modular with the idea for future scalability, as a company grows so does their database.

- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists take a problem or need someone wants and creates somthing to fit the need or solve the problem. They play a critical role in advanced problem solving and technology advancement. Work like thi sproject would help the company improve their data managment, efficiency in work, and data analysis.
